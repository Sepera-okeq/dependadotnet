# Dependadotnet -- Generator for Dependabot config.yml for .NET

[Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) is a service for automatically updating dependencies listed in project files for various languages, including [.NET](https://dependabot.com/dotnet/).

Dependabot works out of the box if you have a solution (`.sln`) or project file (like `.csproj`) at the root. It also apparently supports `packages.config`.

Examples of projects using various patterns with Dependabot:

- Solution at root -- [dustinchilson/NLog.Targets.GraylogHttp](https://github.com/dustinchilson/NLog.Targets.GraylogHttp)
NLog.Targets.GraylogHttp)
- Config at root -- [PowerShell/PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)


If those assets are [nested within your repo](https://github.com/dependabot/feedback/issues/632), then Dependabot won't find them. You can specify them via the Dependabot web configuration UI, but that's not fun if you have lots of projects. Instead, you can generate a configuration file of all your projects. That's what this tool generates.

## Install Tool

This tool is currently only available as source, but will (hopefully) be distributed as a .NET Core tool on NuGet.org. Until then, you can build and install it yourself with the following instructions:

```console
C:\git\dependadotnet\src\dependadotnet>dotnet pack -o nupkg -c release

C:\git\dependadotnet\src\dependadotnet>dotnet tool install -g dependadotnet --add-source .\nupkg
```

## Usage

`dependadotnet [path-to-repo-root]`

Alternatively, if you are in the repo root, you can use the following pattern to avoid needing to write the path:

`dependadotnet .`

The tool writes to stdout. The following pattern is recommended to generate the dependabot config file:

`dependadotnet . > .dependabot\config.yml`

It also supports passing the path via stdin, here demonstrated with `pwd` (for macOS and Linux).

`pwd | dependadotnet`

## Example

[.dependabot/config.yml](.dependabot/config.yml) was generated by this tool.
